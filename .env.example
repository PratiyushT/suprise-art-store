# Zapier Integration
NEXT_PUBLIC_ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID/
ZAPIER_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Replace YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID with your actual Zapier webhook ID
# 3. Generate a strong secret key and replace "your-secret-key-here" (SERVER-SIDE ONLY)
# 4. Use this secret key in Zapier to verify webhook authenticity
# 5. Get your webhook URL from Zapier by creating a new Zap with "Webhooks by Zapier" trigger

# Security Notes:
# - ZAPIER_SECRET_KEY is server-side only and never exposed to browsers
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL can be public (it's just the endpoint)
# - Keep your secret key private and never share it publicly
# - Use a strong, random secret key (minimum 32 characters)
# - In Zapier, check the "X-Zapier-Secret" header matches your secret key
